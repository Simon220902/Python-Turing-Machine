# Python Turing Machine
The three files above are respectively:

## turing.py 
A file containing two classes.
Firstly a program class which assembles the different states.
Secondly a turing machine class that contains the information needed, the tape, program etc.
as well as a methods for executing the turing machine. 

## turingInterface.py
A program providing a poorly done CLI, where you can create a turing machine "program" and test it with different tapes.
You can also run your program in step through GUI.
If you just have an idea for a turing machine this is probably the one to try.

## turingGUI.py
A program providing a GUI for the step through execution of a turing machine.
Try it out in the turingInterface.py.
Type help to get a list of the commands.
Do mind that you need to create both a tape and a program (and give them both some data) for it to be able to execute.
